				<h3> Programming </h3>
				
				<p> When I was around eight years old, my best friend from two houses down moved away to another part of the
				city so I no longer had anyone to hang out with anymore so I started playing video games. Eventually I became
				addicted to them and I decided I wanted to become a video game developer so I started learning programming. My
				aspirations have since changed but solving problems with code remains one of my favourite activities. </p>

				<h3> Linguistics </h3>
				
				<p> My interest in languages started when I was in middle school. I was attempting to learn
				Russian by my self at the time. Even though I obviously failed miserably at actually learning Russian, I <i>did</i> learn
				a great deal about linguistics in general and how languages work. My dad would turn the wifi off at night to make sure I
				went to bed so I would download pdfs of linguistics textbooks off the internet and read them. My favourite field of linguistics
				is historical linguistics which pertains to how languages change over time. </p>

				<h3> Reading </h3>
				
				<p> As a child, I hated reading. Watching TV was so much more interesting. Nonetheless, my parents would force me
				to read because they felt like it was an important skill for a child of my age to be able to have. When they started teaching
				Greek mythology in grade six, I fell head over heels with the subject and I immediately began reading as many books as I could
				about it. My parents were baffled when I refused to go to bed one day because I was engrossed in a book about the War of Troy. Those
				books had a lot of big words in them so they not only intiated my love of reading, but also expanded my vocabulary a great deal. </p>
